As a software engineer passionate about mastering the C++ language, I embarked on creating FitnessPlus. This project is a demonstration of my journey in understanding and utilizing C++ to develop robust and efficient software solutions. FitnessPlus serves as a platform to showcase my skills and knowledge in C++ programming, focusing on syntax, data structures, and best practices.
The software is designed to manage fitness-related data, including user profiles, workout routines, and progress tracking. Through FitnessPlus, users can create personalized workout plans, log their exercises, track their progress, and analyze their performance over time.
My purpose in writing this software is to deepen my understanding of C++ and its application in real-world scenarios. By developing FitnessPlus, I aim to reinforce my knowledge of object-oriented programming, memory management, file handling, and other fundamental concepts of C++ development.
To see a demonstration of FitnessPlus in action and gain insights into the codebase, check the video. In this 4-5 minute video, I walk through the functionality of FitnessPlus and discuss key aspects of the C++ language used in its implementation.
